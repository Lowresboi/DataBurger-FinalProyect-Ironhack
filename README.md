Data Burger - Market and sales Analysis

“The burgers are important... but the data its more!”

Context

Data Burger is a fast-food franchise focused on American-style burgers but always with a unique and daring twist. They want to introduce a new promotion next month, but there are currently three others in the market.

Data Burger wants to know how the active promotions are performing to make a business decision.

These three promotions are evenly distributed in the three markets, spread across several countries. The data provided by Data Burger pertains to this month, divided into weeks, with the revenue of each restaurant with its promotion.

We need to conduct an analysis of the current promotions based on sales, market, and promotion values. Adding more details about the stores or sales per week to make a decision for the next month.

“Enjoy your data!... I mean, your meal!”
